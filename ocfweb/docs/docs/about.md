[[!meta title="About us"]]


## The mission

The OCF is an all-volunteer, student-run, Chartered Program of the [Associated
Students of the University of California (ASUC)][asuc] dedicated to free
computing for all [University of California at Berkeley][berkeley] students,
faculty, and staff.

The mission of the OCF is to:

* Provide all members of Berkeley's campus community the computer resources
  they seek
* To address unmet computing needs
* To provide a place for those interested in computing to fully explore that
  interest

## What do we do?

The Open Computing Facility provides free computing services to students,
faculty, and staff, ranging from printing to expiration-free web hosting to
Unix shell accounts to email.

We operate a long-hours, well-staffed computer lab for accessible in-person
support, as well as online support. In addition, the group also hosts
numerous student group and faculty/staff websites, and provides support to
these and other organizations on campus.

We service over 50,000 users and over 1,000 groups on campus, with
thousands of weekly visitors.

To meet these needs, we are always aiming to secure more resources to fully
meet the needs of the campus community. Our primary resources are our
GNU/Linux workstations and servers, entirely run by [[student volunteers|doc
staff]]. These resources are located within our computing lab on the ground
floor of the MLK Jr. Student Union.

To help people explore the field of computing, the OCF also provides a
variety of educational services. Currently, we host the [UNIX SysAdmin
Decal][decal], and host regular [[Tech Talks|doc staff/techtalks]] that
explore new technologies and how they are relevant to the OCF's
infrastructure.

We also offer e-mail and in-person hours with our volunteer staff members, as
well as online sources of information about computing on the Berkeley campus
and how to use the available resources.

In the past, we have also co-sponsored Help Sessions, short classes taught
throughout the semester on a wide range of computing topics, and conducted
career fairs with our sister organization, the [Computer Science
Undergraduate Association][csua].

## Governance

Policies for this cluster and decisions for the OCF are made by
the OCF Board of Directors, an open body composed of OCF members who are
interested in participating in the decision-making process. The Board
convenes at BoD Meetings, held every week when classes are in session, which
are open to the public and provide a chance for any user to express their
concerns or opinions about the OCF.

All OCF members are welcome to join the Board of Directors, and the general
public is welcome to attend BoD Meetings.

[Minutes of all previous meetings][minutes] are available online.

## How to find us

The OCF is located on the ground floor of the MLK Jr. Student Union. For

The Open Computing Facility is a student group acting independently of the
University of California. We take full responsibility for our organization
and this website.
